This is a first person game where you travel to space next to a train.
Move with wsad keys, but watch out! You are in space so there is no gravity!(Except for when you are above your beloved train)
While travelling in space you can collect Items such as gold, coal or wood, but not asteroids, using E.
Use also E to ring the bell in front of your train to scare away the dangerous space shark (How did it get there??) If you are too slow the shark will damage your train and if the 
train's health goes to 0, you will be lost in space and die.
To advance you will need to go to the depo stage using B, there you can interact with the blue screen to repair the train or upgrade it using the materials collected in space.
Once you upgraded your train enough, you will be able to get back to earth and be safe.
